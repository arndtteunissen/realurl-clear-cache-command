# Clear realurl cache tables

This extension adds a simple extbase command to clear the realurl cache tables.

Only works for TYPO3 8.7 because it uses the Doctrine QueryBuilder.

## Installation
An installation with composer is suggested. Use 

`composer require arndtteunissen/realurl-clear-cache-command`

to install this extension.
